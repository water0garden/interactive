  <p> The weather is mild and the tide is quite high. I'm currently in WhaÄ«ngaroa, Aotearoa. This is where my Whaunua live. Shirley and Tony. I have been over in Europe for the past year. Now I'm back on my whenua recouping from travel. My jetlag has subsided so about a week ago I decided to take this course. Here I am now saying how and keeping you up to speed. I may tune back in here each week to share progress and update as I learn and grow. <br>
  </p>

  <p> The other day I though about how maybe we are Eggplants. We begin as eggs and then we grow not green like plants. I like the idea of planting thoughts here. As if my thoughts are seeds blowing in the air. </p>
