  <h1>Hello world of current spring !</h1>
  <p class="special">
    Things are happening here, well it's the nonlinear front of conditions and feelings . Outside your glass, brick, gib, ply, various wood grains and arc's of covering a spring being as yourself. You may find yourself in rain fade. Rain fade is caused by absorption of a microwave radio frequency (RF) signal by atmospheric rain, snow, or ice, and losses which are especially prevalent at frequencies above 11 GHz. It also refers to the degradation of a signal caused by the electromagnetic interference of the leading edge of a storm front. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_fade"> Well, says Wiki.</a> </p> <br>

 <p>When I was younger I really enjoyed rain fade. I like the quiet eerie feeling. Silence with family from interrupting storms. I haven't experienced rain fade for a while. I don't watch TV. What I do is lounge at times and look out. I can see, hear and feel the rain. It comes in those waves. Like many other waves that may full you with some kind of energy. In these moments i find myself thinking in some or another way. Or I question. Where is this front of thinking coming from? How and then why do trail off... These days I wonder why I half heartedly know about certain things. Is there an Aura that I want things to always have, like thats there thing you have your thing I don't want to own your thing. You keep your thing you have. I don't want to dominantly know you. Keep growing i think, all the things I want to learn about will keep growing and showing. Spring rain stops. </p> <br>

<p>Traveling:      hi
So, I'm here on the bus right now,  sleepily smoothing over smothered lands of a newborn heat delivered in the new month.  I thought I should write to you and then I looked outside and saw a clock tower. It's 16.16 the clock in the bus is an hour behind. This reminds me of my youth.  Long drives I would do with my mum in Aotearoa from the east to the west coast.
The clock not bothered by daylight saving and my mother ambilivant with  too many girls to look after to register any significant need to care. I didn't care either, all  I did on those drives was thought gazing out the window, I always felt a little guilty about my hours spent just staring out, those hours could've been beneficial in any other way I thought then my eyes carelessly chutting over landscapes pondering now forgotton thoughts the everything sponging together in a my thought my eyes, my discarding thoughts.  I was thinking about this thought gazing of my youth on a bus ride from Amsterdam to Paris. How many lost thoughts & so many hours of staring out those windows. This is white noise for my eyes, a blink every now and again. A thought trailing off. I read somewhere about a medidative state a person taps into in these moments. Staring out into the void, a blank mind. Theres always something going on  surely. I don't remember the book. </p>
